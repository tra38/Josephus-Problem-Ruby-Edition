# Josephus-Problem-Ruby-Edition
This variant of the traditional "Josephus Problem" originally came from "Programming and Problem Solving with C++", by Nell Dale, Chip Weems, and Mark Headington, and published in 1997. The problem's text (pg. 1154-1155) is reprinted below:

"A group of soldiers is overwhelmed by an enemy force. Only one person can go for help because they only have one horse. To decide which soldier should go for help, they put their names in a helmet and put one slip of paper for each soldier with a number on it in another helmet. For example, if there are five soldiers, then the second helmet contains give pieces of paper wit the number 1 to 5 each written on a separate slip.

The soldiers arrange themselves in a circle and pull a name and number from the helmets. Starting with the person who named was pulled, they count off in a clockwise direction until they reach the number that was pulled. When the count stops, that soldier is eliminated from the circle. This continues until there is one soldier left, and that soldier rides for help."

This Ruby program serves to simulate this variant, using recurison.
